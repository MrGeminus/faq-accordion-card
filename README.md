## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Accessibility focus
- BEM naming convention
- CSS3
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

While working on this project, I have discovered the experimental :has() CSS Selector.

Itâ€™s essentially a parent selector, although far more useful than just that.

In the below example, I utilize it to select and move the box illustration which is located inside an element with the class of card if the card contains a element without the open attribute that is directly followed by a hovered element with the class of faq__question.

``
`css`

.card:has(:not(.faq[open]) > .faq__question:hover) > .card__box-illustration {
        transform: translateX(-1.9rem);
    }

``

The browser support currently isn't the greatest, but that may change in the future.

### Continued development

I would definitely like to further improve in areas of accessibility and semantics.
