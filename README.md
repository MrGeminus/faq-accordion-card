## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Accessibility focus
- BEM naming convention
- CSS3
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

While working on this project, I have learned about the experimental :has() CSS Selector.

Itâ€™s essentially a parent selector, although far more useful than just that.

In the below example, I utilize it to select and move the box illustration which is located inside an element with the class of card if that card contains an element without an open attribute that is directly followed by a hovered element with the class of faq__question.

```css

.card:has(:not(.faq[open]) > .faq__question:hover) > .card__box-illustration {
        transform: translateX(-1.9rem);
    }

```

If the browser doesn't support the selector this rule will be ignored and the box won't move on the page.

The browser support currently isn't the greatest, but that may change in the future.

### Continued development

I would definitely like to further improve in areas of accessibility and semantics.
